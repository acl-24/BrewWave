## About the APP
BrewWave is a BCI-enabled radio playing web app that allows users to control radio playback using their brain signals. By leveraging EEG data, users can effortlessly switch between radio stations, pause, and resume playback, creating a seamless and hands-free radio experience.

Our inspiration for BrewWave comes from the desire to create a unique and immersive experience by combining brain-computer interface (BCI) technology with radio streaming. We aimed to revolutionize the way users interact with and control their radio stations through neural signals. Our goal was to create accessibility options for individuals with severe disabilities, allowing them the freedom to choose a radio station of their preference and providing them with more independence.
